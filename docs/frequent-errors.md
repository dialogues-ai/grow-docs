# Known Bugs


:::info For best use:
1. Grow is best used on a computer with a screen and mouse.
2. Make sure there is a good internet connection.
3. Entries can be made on mobile.
4. The stats can be viewed on a tablet, but much of the interactive features work best with a mouse, not a finger.

## Category Inputs

May cause entry submission errors.

Press `Enter` instead of Tab. Your category field should have a small icon to its left, as shown in the second image.
<img src="/grow-docs/img/entry_screen/error_category_entry.png" width="180"/>
<img src="/grow-docs/img/entry_screen/correct_category_entry.png" width="172"/>

If the category is left as it is in the first image, the entry sheet will not submit.


## App Load Error

Sometimes the app fails to load for a number of reasons.  
Simply try a hard refresh. â™º

If a refresh doesn't work, make sure you have a strong internet connection. The app frequently fails to load on mobile if there is not a strong internet connection.
