# Privacy Policy

### Overview

A Letter to All Grow Users,

Welcome to privacy at Dialogues, the creator of Grow. To us, privacy means that you control the data anyone else sees--even us. If any of your data were to appear before another person's eyes, it would be because you consented to put it there.

This applies to us. Eventhough you use the software,  your agreement to use it does not mean you agree for us to read it.  All of your entries are kept secure, and can only be read if you directly share your entries with our organization. Simply typing into the software and using our software does not mean you've consented to share your entries with the organization. You will have consented for us to store them, but not consented for us to read them.

We at Grow, have two priorities:
1. Provide privacy first software for you to record your life, and develop your own private langauge.
2. Offer a service to read and analyze your entries.

We have some excellent services we wish to offer, but it fell dependent on providing the first priority.

The following outlines the data collected for the privacy-first software. There will be greater details for the shared part of our service when that arrives. When it does, it will appear very directly, and we will grade the quality of our privacy to the same standards as everyone else on the platform.

Because there is no shared features yet, as of right now, no data is read by anyone, and there are no counterparties but yourself, the  account holder, to read it. When it comes time to share messages, we will be extremely clear about the terms of consent, and who the information is being sent to.

At present, any AI will be very naively trained on data without the data ever being read. These models will be built for demo purposes, and there are plans in place to increase communication between users and services that are AI providers.

Privacy, and making the distinction between private and public communication, is very important to us, and you will see these values reflected in the product(s) we build. We have a very clear definition for what is private data versus what is public data, and we will create tools to enable you to control what is said to your own self, versus what is said publicly.

Finally, we are not starving for advertisers' money. We are building a different business model. Our software is built on establishing relationships between people, and we think advertisers either have no business getting into the conversation, period, or they water-down the relationships and interactions between people.

All of that said, we operate within limits, and respect the boundaries of these limiations we put forth. The user has an inalienable right to preserve the integrity of their personal dialogue.

We want to be upfront about how we treat your personal data: what data we do collect, why we collect it, where it all goes, and for how long. So we wrote this privacy policy to explain it to you in the clearest, simplest way we know how.

In addition to this privacy policy, please read our [Terms of Service] which also applies to your use of the product. It’s also where you can find any terms not directly defined in this policy.

And as always, if you have any questions or suggestions, give us a shout at [info@dialogues.ai](mailto:info@dialogues.ai). We’re all ears!

### Important Definitions

The following are terms that are frequently referred to in this privacy policy but not common in everyday language. We wanted to take a bit of extra time to explain them.

-   Personal Data means any information that identifies or relates to a particular individual (often referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “PII”).  
-   Shared Data means any information from your Private Data you wish to share with other users, on or off the platform, or organizations or services on the platform.
-   Service Providers help us run our business and provide the Services to you. They may include:
    -   Hosting, analytics, database, and communication providers, such as the authentication service we use to allow you to log into your account.
    -   Support and customer service software providers, such as the software our team uses to communicate with you when you report a bug.
    -   Security consultants who help us reduce security vulnerabilities in our software.
    Service Providers are contractually required to only handle your data in ways that we specify, including being contractually prohibited from selling your data.
-   Anonymized Data is data that is completely anonymized and cannot be linked with an individual user is NOT considered Personal Data.

### What personal data do we collect and how do we collect it?

#### When you use the Grow App


| Category of Personal Data | Example | When we collect this data  | Examples of why we collect this data|
| ----| ---| ---| --- |
| Profile or Contact Data | Name, Email | Directly from you, when you choose to give it to us (such as when you sign up for an account) | -   So that you can log into your account -   So that we can contact you |
 | Device Data | Type of device and operating system used to access the Services | Automatically, when you use our desktop application | -   To understand the range of devices our software should support -   To debug software issues specific to certain devices or operating systems
| Product Usage Data | How often you use various product features. Inferences drawn from your product usage data, for instance, “People love using the Storyboard UI!” | Automatically, when you use our desktop application | -   To understand feature usage and improve our product -   Product Usage Data never includes the content of your entries.


#### When you reach out directly or otherwise choose to give us information

For instance, when you submit a bug report or request support, we’ll collect the information you share with us to help solve your problem. Typically, these conversations have to do with bugs in the user interface and not with the contents of your entries. As such, your entries are not shared with Grow, Dialogues, or any customer service agents with Grow or Dialogues.

If we need to look up your account on our side, the information displayed is:
1. Username
2. Email
3. Last entry made
4. Number of entries

No one on our side reads, or sees, the content of any entries when you ask for help.

#### When you visit our website, [grow.dialogues.ai](https://grow.dialogues.ai/)

Our provider uses IP addresses to maintain unique visitor counts and the geographic distribution of the site traffic. At present, we use Google, so Google will have the email associated with this account, its address, and know it uses this app. What else they do with that information, I (jonny) actually don't know.

#### When you choose to use certain features

All of your entries are your data and no one will read them. This data we call your private data. We treat this as your vault to which no one has access, even ourselves.

The next level of data will be those entries in which you choose to share with people. When you agree to share your private data with people, you are trusting them to handle your data fairly. Because screen shots can be taken, and text copied, this data can easily exit our ecosystem, and be transferred anywhere else.

Since the sharing ability has not been built yet, we will not go into details, but we are considering, in great detail, how to help you build trust with other people and counterparties to whom you wish to share your information. Measures will be taken to create read receipts (by who and when), and reputation points for the organization whom you trust to read your data.

More details to come.

### How we treat Anonymized Data?

We treat Anonymized Data differently than most organizations. Information is interesting (it is highly complex--because no information is even information), and it seems people can connect even the most unobvious data points together to find out who a person is. This is not a game we want to play.

Additionally, we do not anonymize Personal Data then assume it is a different class of data that we can legally analyze and read. Where many companies treat anonymized data as non-personal data, meaning the data has transformed and can be read and shared freely, we simply do not do this.

At the base-level of the Grow app. Everything written into Grow is stored and unavailable for access by anyone, but the account holder.

Anonymization comes into play once you start sharing your data with third parties. We will bake anonymization of data into the grading rubric of the third-parties you wish to share your information with. The organization's privacy grade will appear on their reputation card, and will list if their organization anonymizes data before reading it, or processing it through their AI analyzers. Obviously, if they do this, then they will get a higher grade.

We greatly believe AI models, or people for that matter, can get enough information to do their job even if the following data points are eliminated or obscured:
- Time of day
- People
- Places
- Emotions

Whether an AI model needs to train on actual PII data or anonymized data will depend on the use case of that AI model. Ultimately, we will have to leave this choice up to the service providers, but we can make it transparent which organizations go through this extra step of privacy to protect your information.

### Under what conditions would we share your personal data?

We never sell your data, and we’ll only share it in the following circumstances:

-   If you ask us to. We’ll share your data when you directly authorize it to be shared or share it yourself.
-   If needed to meet our legal requirements or safety measures, or to enforce legal rights. See "Why do we collect personal data?" below for more.
-   If there’s a change in company ownership such as a merger, acquisition, or bankruptcy, your data may be transferred to the new controlling party. Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.

### Why do we collect personal data?

In general, we collect personal data to provide and improve our product and Services. This includes data to make the Application work (such as account information) or data to make the Application better (such as Device or Product Usage Data). We also collect data to make sure we’re able to:

-   Protect against fraud, or implement additional security measures.
-   Correspond with you if you reach out with a bug report, support request, or general inquiry. We may also send you updates, product information, or other marketing communications.
-   Meet legal requirements, safety measures, and enforce legal rights. We're required to comply with any legal process, law, or regulation that requests we disclose personal information we’ve collected, so long as we consider the request reasonable and lawful. This includes:
    -   Enforcing our agreement terms or resolving disputes.
    -   Protecting your rights, property, or safety, or that of any party that interacts with our product.

### How do we store and protect your data?

As of 12/1/2022, we use a cloud service provider to store your data. We actively seek improvements and even new methods of storage to meet the highest level of security we can offer and meet the desired storage preferences for our users.

We do our best to protect the Personal Data we collect from any unauthorized parties accessing, using, or sharing it, but it’s important to remember that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is 100% secure. We also ask you to help us out with protecting your data. Easy steps include creating a strong password and limiting access to your device and account credentials.

We hold on to Personal Data for as long as you have an account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. We'll only hang on to it for longer if needed to meet our legal requirements discussed above, or if it’s anonymized so that it can’t be linked to a specific user.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We’re constantly trying to improve our product and services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we’ll let you know by placing a notice on the app and on the Grow & Dialogues website and/or contacting you directly, most likely via email.

If you opted not to receive legal notice emails (— we get it), or you haven’t given us your email in the first place, the updated policy will still apply. We’ll do our best to get these updates in front of you, however, the ball’s ultimately in your court to read and understand them. If you continue to use the product we’ll assume the updates are good with you. Of course, give us a shout if there’s anything that needs further explaining.
