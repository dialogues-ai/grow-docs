# Welcome to Grow!  
<img src="/grow-docs/img/armed-image.png" width="90" align="right"/>

Hi! Welcome to Grow! This can be a very cool tool for you to use in your life. It ought to act like a companion in your pocket to jot down what you are doing and when. It's for you to tell your story as you go along.

I hope this works with you in your life.  
If it doesn't now, maybe it can in the future.     ~jonny

## Why Grow?

Grow acts as a way to get your thoughts and activities recorded when they happen. It is designed to be minimally intrusive to your attention. We want to represent the values of items in your life, so you can monitor your time spent doing them.

If your Mom is important, you can easily see how you're tending to that relationship.
If it is a sport, or hobby, you care about, writing about it in the journal can give you a place to state that is valuable, have it reflected back at you, and monitor how you are tending to it.

Just 5 posts a day, could be only a minute with the app, but, in just one week, you'll have 30+ entries stating what you were up to and a place that represents your values, in terms of the important: 
1. People in your life
2. Places where you spend your time
3. And the activities you are up to

Write what you did, then investigate those entries to recall where you left off on a project, or see if it needs some TLC.

This platform has been built so you have better dialogues with yourself, with improved memory, and reinforced sets of personal values.

## How Grow is different

Grow is meant to offer a place to write down what happened.

As a byproduct it can act as habit-building, and time-tracking tool, but differs from the present ones available because it has a better organizational system. Others are limited in hierarchical structures, relating sub-projects with one another, changing names of projects, and starting fresh with new projects. Grow allows for all of these.

Grow is also different from project management tools, because life is not a project, it is a journey. Grow enables you to [keep a record](https://youtu.be/ohk3DP5fMCg?t=67), and not to plan out what should happen in the future.


## What you'll get

Finally, all of this is meant for your eyes only. Your writing becomes honest and open when the outside world isn't looking over your shoulder. Then, from this state, it is easier to move in the direction best-suited to you. 

Our relationship as an organization is between us and you. We are not judgmental. Our job is to be a papermaker. We provide a medium and do not say what is appropriate or not to write. When it comes time- if you desire, and when the app permits- to enable sharing entries with people you trust, that will be up to you to make an agreement made between you and them. When that time comes, we will let you know.
