# Welcome to Grow!  
<img src="/grow-docs/img/armed-image.png" width="90" align="right"/>

Hi! Welcome to Grow! This can be a very cool tool for you to use in your life. It should feel like the Robin to your Batman. As is, you'll get to record your life down in a journal, which has always been thought of as a good activity, but like flossing, it just doesn't get done. Hopefully, we can make it a little more interesting, and valuable!, than regular journaling by adding some cool features to it, to give you insights into your life. Our job is not to tell you who you are. Our job is to reflect back what you did and said, highlight your values, and let you see how you are becoming.

All of your entries are stored securely with Google Cloud Platform; we are not managing the servers ourselves. Also, there's a way to export everything you've written. These are your entries, not ours, and you must have full access to all of them. (It is our access which should be limited!) Eventually, we'll create a way for you store the data yourself without them ever touching our hands. We want to be the paper makers, not the vault keepers.

This is a beta product, so there are some buggy things. It's been important to create the tools to enable the product first; every day without having written, was a day of less importance. To make up for some of the haste, we've supplied a [Known Bugs](../frequent-errors) page. As of July 2022, we are finally able to capture most of what was invisioned to write, and, can finally circle back to start upgrading the software's quality.

I hope this works with you in your life.  
If it doesn't now, maybe it can in the future.     ~jonny

## Why Grow?

Grow acts as a way to get your thoughts and activities recorded when they happen. It is designed to be minimally intrusive to your attention so you can make a post, then get on with your day. 

Hopefully, each post takes only 10 seconds to make-they don't have to be long, and I'll show you some [examples](../setup/create-post). 

The idea is: With just 5 posts a day, you'll have spent less than a minute with the app. But, in just that time, by the end of the week, you'll have 30+ entries stating what you were up to throughout the week, and stats available about how your time is allocated between different people, places, and things.

Grow offers a structured approach to journaling so that you can quickly write down what you did, then investigate those entries to recall where you had left off on a project, or get some insights to your overall activity levels.

Eventually, an interactive framework will be built around this information so you have better dialogues with yourself, with improved memory, and reinforced sets of personal values.

## How Grow is different

Grow is meant to offer a place to write down what happened. 

As a byproduct it can act as habit-building, and time-tracking tool, but differs from the present ones available because it has a better organizational system. Others are limited in hierarchical structures, relating sub-projects with one another, changing names of projects, and starting fresh with new projects. Grow allows for all of these.

Grow is also different from project management tools, because life is not a project, it is a journey. Grow enables you to [keep a record](https://youtu.be/ohk3DP5fMCg?t=67), and not to plan out what should happen in the future.


## What you'll get

The structure of the journal allows in-depth feedback about your time doing particular activities, how those activities changed over time, and how you might have felt during the activity while doing it.

If kept, this journal allows us to give you a weekly summary of your activities, for what was the most notable things that occurred, what activities are trending, what new person might have entered your life, what location used to be the hotspot, which location is on the way out, and more. Some of these features are already available, and some are on the way.

Finally, the primary purpose for this app was to document important information to one's life. The typical social media game has a lot of chest-pounding, and pontificating and rewards people with followers and likes, which, to me, doesn't reflect the kind of person I care to be, not reflects the kidns of things I care about discussing. So, Grow offers a way to tell stories of one's existence.

You can state: what you made, how you felt, who you were with, where you were at, and tell the storeis of your life when they happen. With short entries every day, by the end of a year, you'll have a full year's worth of stories, and have created a very precise memoir-like thing with only a little effort each day.

For more tips on what to include in your entries check out the guide. (Guide coming soon...)

And, finally, all of this is meant for your eyes only. Your writing becomes honest and open when the outside world isn't looking over your shoulder. Then, from this state, it is easier to move in the direction best-suited to you.
