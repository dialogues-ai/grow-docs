# Create Graph

The graph and snapshot are the last steps to setting up your journal. And the graph takes just a little planning. Together we'll create a simple graph, and you can add to it, and start a new one as you get a grasp of it.

Here is an example from journaling my work on Grow:

![/img/graph_screen/graph_sample](/img/graph_screen/graph_sample.png)

The way you build this here, combined with the [snapshot](create-snapshot), goes towards setting up the accounting metrics for the radar chart, and the time-tunnel.


1. ~~Make an entry.~~
2. **Setup your first graph.**
3. Add snapshot from the graph.



## 1. Start Fresh Page

First off, you need to start a fresh page. It's easy.
1. Click the `Start your journey` page.

2. Select `Blank` page.
3. Give your new page a title. (You can edit this later.)

4. Select `Turn the page` in the bottom right.

5. Enjoy the animation! From old page to new!

6. When the animation is complete, you are ready to setup your graph! ðŸŽ‰


## 2. Add Nodes to Graph

We need to add some nodes to the graph.

1. In the upper right hand of the screen, select the `Nodes List` box.
2. Tap the hamburger menu icon to display all the available nodes.

:::info No nodes appear

If no nodes are appearing in your list when you click the menu button. Hard refresh your application. (Hold shift and press the broswer refresh button.) On startup, sometimes, these nodes aren't downloaded, and the app needs to restart to grab them. So, restart your application, and come back to this page. You should see the first nodes here.
:::

3. Tap the ` + ` next to the nodes to add them to the graph. Go ahead and add them all.

Your initial graph ought to look similar to this.  
You might have an added category from the [Create Entry](create-post) step included.

:::tip Zoom out!
This beta version currently scales these starting nodes to be HUGE!
Zoom out so you can see them on your screen. When you add them, the nodes start very large, and to the left.

## 3. Create 3 Activities

Let's add a few more items to the graph. In the top right, where it says, create a node.  
1. Let's add these three nodes:
    1. Class
    2. Homework
    3. Exercise

Type the names into the field and press `Enter` or tap the ` âž¡ ` button.

They should appear in the list.

Bonus: Add
i. Weights
ii. Ultimate Frisbee

2. Add all the new nodes to your graph.

Tap the ` + ` next to all your new nodes to add them to the graph.

You should get something like this.

## 4. Build a Graph

Now you get to construct your graph!

Simply drag and drop one node on to another. You can drag whole graphs onto others. Play around with this.

Here's the final one.

<img src="/img/graph_screen/final_graph_from_tutorial.png" width="480"/>

Delete unwanted node from the graph by pressing the ` - ` next to its name from the list, or by dragging and dropping it onto the trash button that appears while dragging.

<img src="/img/graph_screen/remove_trash_target.png" width="200"/>

:::info Trash Target Doesn't Go Away

Sometimes the trash menu does not go away. 
1. First press save to keep your changes.
2. Try pressing the home button on the side panel, and come back to the graph.
3. If that doesn't work, hard refresh the app.

## 5. Press Save!

Save your changes before you leave the page!!!

## Next Steps

After you have created this graph. Now you are ready to make the snapshots. The snapshots will help you create groupings on the graph of which you would like to relate.
