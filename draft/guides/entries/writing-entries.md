## Creating Entries

The entry is the foundation of your journal. Your charts and weekly summaries will only be as good as the entries you write.

The entry is setup in a way to write what your goal is, and what you accomplished. With it, tag who you were with (write "Solo" or click the person icon if it is just yourself), write your location where you were during the event.
